# High Performace Computing for Data Science
## This is a project for High Performace Computing for Data Science course at University of Trento
In this project, we provide some implementation for some popular datamining algorithm in parallel paradigms. These implementation will be evaluated and compared with sequence algorithms. 
All the test will be perform in Unitn hpc's cluster.


## Algorithms
1. K-mean - hierarchical clustering
2. Classification
3. Linear regression
4. Finding frequent item set.

## Domain
1. Flower classification
2. http://fimi.uantwerpen.be/data/
